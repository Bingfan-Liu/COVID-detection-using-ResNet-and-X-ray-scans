# COVID-detection-using-ResNet-and-X-ray-scans

Data from: https://www.kaggle.com/tawsifurrahman/covid19-radiography-database

This is a project where a ResNet18 was implemented for classifying the COVID X-Ray scan utilizing the power of GPU. The whole training process took about 2 minutes for the pretrained model and 10 minutes for the non-pretrained model and reached a prediction accuracy that was above 90% on the test set. While better parameter tuning can be done, considering the purpose of this project is for education and interview, I didn't do a detailed tuning.
